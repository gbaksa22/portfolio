# GB Digital Portfolio üåê

Welcome to the repository for **GB Digital**, my personal portfolio website! üéâ

## About the Project

This project is a **work-in-progress** Angular-based portfolio website where I aim to showcase my professional journey, projects, and skills. The final site will serve as a central hub for anyone interested in learning more about me and my work.

### Features (Planned)
- **Home Page**: A quick introduction and links to my key sections.
- **Portfolio**: A showcase of my projects, highlighting technologies and impact.
- **Contact**: A way to get in touch with me.

### Current Status
I am actively building this project, so the repository may change frequently as I add new features, refine designs, and improve functionality.
